# Terminal Portfolio Website

## Overview
This is a **personal portfolio website** built entirely with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** — no frameworks, no external plugins.  
The site follows a **terminal-based UI/UX** theme, simulating a retro command-line interface with animated cursor effects, a boot sequence, and scroll-locked terminal output.

The project fulfills all **Web Development Fundamentals** rubric requirements, including:
- Three HTML pages: **Résumé**, **Cover Letter**, and **Career Goals**
- One shared external CSS stylesheet
- At least one local image, audio file, and video file
- JavaScript functionality to display the current date and log a custom console message
- Form, table, semantic HTML elements, and advanced CSS selectors
