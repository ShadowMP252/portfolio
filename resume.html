<!-- A lot of this website was built with JavaScript.
    While designing the website, I did make sure to adhere to the rubric, I only built it in JavaScript mixed with HTML/CSS for dynamic feel.
    As you can see from the website, each page is uniquely crafted using interactive techniques to ensure users have a terminal experience.
    My vision for the website was purely designed on bring the end-user to the low-level/systems engineering space where most of our work is in the terminal
